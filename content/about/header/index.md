<!-- this is a subheadline -->
Welcome to my blog! The above greeting is a common phrase in Lebanon, where it translates to "Hi, how are you, are you good?". I'd like to think of this sentence as a direct representation of my identity. Half Lebanese, Half American, but fully an integration of each and every culture I have come int contact with over the period of my life.
